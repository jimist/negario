# Choosing Graph Toolkits for Web

## Final

D3js is good as backbone for future, but not now.

- [G6](https://github.com/antvis/G6) as the main graph visualization library
- [Meteorjs](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) has good opportunity for partnership, they're growing but don't have momentum
- [Apache ECharts](https://github.com/apache/echarts) is advanced charting with English documents
